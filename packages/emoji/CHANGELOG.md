## 5.1.0 - 2019-10-30

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added an `avoidFetch` option to `useEmojiData`.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where different types of emoji patterns (hexcodes, shortcodes, unicode characters)
  used in the same string weren't always being converted.
- Fixed `emojibase-test-utils/test-data.json` being pulled into a Webpack bundle on accident.

# 5.0.0 - 2019-10-29

#### 💥 Breaking

- Updated `interweave` peer requirement to v12.
- Updated `react` requirement to v16.8.
- Updated `emojiPath` prop to receive an object of sizes as the 2nd argument, instead of the 3
  trailing size arguments.
- Removed the `withEmojiData` HOC.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `emojibase` to v3, which includes new 2019 emojis.
- Added a new `useEmojiData` hook.
- Rewrote all components to use function components. Reduced file sizes by 28%.

#### 🛠 Internals

- Updated `useEmojiData` to fake all CDN fetches when `NODE_ENV` is "test" or `fetch` is undefined,
  unless `INTERWEAVE_ALLOW_FETCH_EMOJI` is explicitly defined. This should make testing emoji aware
  components in consumers much easier.

#### 📦 Dependencies

- Updated all dependencies.

### 4.1.1 - 2019-09-23

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Updated `withEmojiData` to no longer set state if the component has been unmounted.

## 4.1.0 - 2019-05-09

#### 🚀 Updates

- `withEmojiData` version now defaults to the Emojibase `package.json` version instead of `latest`.
  This change has been made as Emojibase v3 has been released, which supports Emoji/Unicode v12, but
  most systems do not support this specification yet, so we want to lock to the latest Emojibase v2
  version.

#### 🚀 Updates

#### 🎉 Release

#### 💥 Breaking

- Refactored `EmojiLoader` into an HOC named `withEmojiData`, as the original approach would not
  re-render components correctly in some situations.
- Updated `emojiSize` and `emojiLargeSize` props to accept a string or number, and to default to
  `1em` and `3em` respectively.
  - If using a number, it will pass through to React (which uses `px`).
  - If using a string, it will be used as-is (`1em`).
- Updated `emojiLargeSize` to no longer auto-multiply size. The prop must be defined manually.

#### 🚀 Updates

  - `emojis` - An array of loaded emoji data.

- Updated `emojibase-regex` to 1.0.6.

# Pre-1.0.0

This package was originally part of `interweave` but over time, it grew too large and unwieldy. In
an effort to reduce bloat and dependencies, the emoji functionality was broken off into this
package. The 1.0.0 release mentioned above contains breaking changes against its previous core
implementation.
