#### 🛠 Internals

- Updated all `@types` dependencies to use `*` version.

# 11.0.0 - 2019-04-26

The previous version of Interweave would attempt to render valid parent and child hierarchies based
on their `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block` presentation. This worked for the majority, but broke
down hard in minority edge cases. This valid rendering hierarchy has been rewritten from the ground
up using
[content categories](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories).
Because of this, some old HTML may now be invalid, while some additional HTML tags are now
renderable.

#### 💥 Breaking

- Updated IE requirement to v11.
- Renamed `TAGS_BLACKLIST` to `BANNED_TAG_LIST`.
- Removed `PARSER_ALLOW`, `PARSER_DENY`, `TYPE_INLINE`, `TYPE_BLOCK`, `TYPE_INLINE_BLOCK`,
  `CONFIG_INLINE`, and `CONFIG_BLOCK` constants.

- Removed `iframe` and `canvas` tags from the banned list. They are not in the default allow list
  but can be enabled by the consumer.

#### 🚀 Updates

- `Parser` and `Element` are now exported from the index.
- Added `TYPE_FLOW`, `TYPE_SECTION`, `TYPE_HEADING`, `TYPE_PHRASING`, `TYPE_EMBEDDED`,
  `TYPE_INTERACTIVE`, and `TYPE_PALPABLE` constants.
- Added `allowAttributes` prop, which disables all non-banned HTML attribute filtering.
- Added `allowElements` prop, which disables all non-banned HTML element filtering.
- Added `allowList` prop, which only enables specific HTML elements. Defaults to the
  `ALLOWED_TAG_LIST` constant.
- Added `blockList` prop, which disables specific HTML elements.
- Added `escapeHtml` prop, which escapes all HTML before parsing.
- Added support for HTML tags: `bdi`, `bdo`, `caption`, `col`, `colgroup`, `rb`, `rp`, `rt`, `rtc`,
  `ruby`, `small`.

#### 🛠 Internals

- Removed `@babel/runtime` as it wasn't saving much space.
- **[TS]** Switched to project references.
- **[TS]** Updated `NodeConfig` to match the new rendering strategy.
