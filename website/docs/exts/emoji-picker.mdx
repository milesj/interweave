## Requirements

- React 16.8+ / 17+
- Interweave + Emoji
- [Emojibase][emojibase]

## Installation

<Tabs
  groupId="package-manager"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add interweave interweave-emoji interweave-emoji-picker emojibase
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install interweave interweave-emoji interweave-emoji-picker emojibase
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

To utilize the emoji picker, import and render the `<EmojiPicker />` component. The picker renders
in place, so any positioning or display toggling should be done manually.

```tsx
import EmojiPicker from 'interweave-emoji-picker';
```

```tsx
<EmojiPicker emojiSize={24} emojiLargeSize={48} emojiPath={getSvgPathForEmoji} />
```

The [sizing and path emoji props](./emoji.mdx#displaying-svgs-or-pngs) are required. View the
[TypeScript interface](https://github.com/milesj/interweave/blob/master/packages/emoji-picker/src/Picker.tsx)
for a list of all available props.

## Allow and block lists

Sometimes specific emojis should not be used, like the poop emoji. This can easily be achieved with
the `blockList` prop, which accepts an array of hexcodes.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker
	blockList={[
		'1F4A9', // poop
		'1F52B', // gun
	]}
/>
```

The inverse, the `allowList` prop, can be used for situations where a restricted list of emojis
should _only_ be used. This also accepts an array of hexcodes.

```tsx
// Only trees
<EmojiPicker
	allowList={[
		'1F332', // evergreen
		'1F333', // deciduous
		'1F334', // palm
		'1F384', // christmas
		'1F38B', // tanabata
	]}
/>
```

## Commonly used

When an emoji is selected (clicked on), we keep a history known as "commonly used", and display a
custom group within the emoji list. This history has two modes, recently used and frequently used,
and can be customized with the `commonMode` prop. Selected emojis that fall past the
`maxCommonlyUsed` prop are trimmed from the history.

- `recently-used` - Tracks selected emojis from most recently selected to oldest.
- `frequently-used` - Tracks selected emojis using a counter, in descending order.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker commonMode="frequently-used" />
```

The commonly used feature can be disabled with the `disableCommonlyUsed` prop.

> Commonly used emojis are stored in local storage.

## Changing appearance

This picker is quite customizable, if not the most customizable, when it comes to its visual
appearance. Every aspect of the picker can be changed, whether it be the order of elements, hiding
or showing elements, the number of emojis to render, and more. I'll try to keep this rather short.

To change the number of visible emojis rendered in the list, define the `columnCount` and `rowCount`
props.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker columnCount={15} rowCount={5} />
```

To change the default selected group tab or skin tone palette, define the `defaultGroup` and
`defaultSkinTone` props respectively.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker defaultGroup="food-drink" defaultSkinTone="medium" />
```

By default, the picker renders elements in the following order: emoji being hovered preview at the
top, followed by the list of emojis, the search bar, and the group tabs. This order can be changed
with the `displayOrder` prop, which accepts an array of strings.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker displayOrder={['groups', 'search', 'emojis', 'preview']} />
```

To disable one of the elements mentioned previously, pass a `disableGroups`, `disablePreview`,
`disableSearch`, or `disableSkinTones` prop.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker disableSearch disableSkinTones />
```

To hide emoticons or shortcodes within the preview, pass the `hideEmoticon` or `hideShortcodes`
props. Furthermore, to hide group headers (but still use group tabs), pass `hideGroupHeaders`.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker hideEmoticon hideGroupHeaders />
```

## Customizing icons

To customize the icons displayed in the group tabs, pass an object of nodes to the `groupIcons`
([list](https://github.com/milesj/interweave/blob/master/packages/emoji-picker/src/constants.ts#L58))
prop. By default the picker uses native emoji but can render React components.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker
	groupIcons={{
		activities: <IconBasketball />,
	}}
/>
```

## Customizing styles

The picker is not styled by default as it allows consumers to easily customize the CSS to match
their application. There are 2 approaches to styling the picker, the first by writing CSS that
follows the
[class names provided by Interweave](https://github.com/milesj/interweave/blob/master/packages/emoji-picker/src/constants.ts#L101).

```css
.interweave-picker__picker {
	position: 'absolute';
	bottom: 100%;
}
```

The second by writing CSS and passing an object of custom class names to the `classNames` prop. This
approach enables non-standard solutions, like CSS modules and CSS-in-JS.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker
	classNames={{
		picker: 'picker-7sa92dsd',
	}}
/>
```

The `emojiPadding` prop is an exception to the CSS pattern, as it pads the emoji button using inline
styles. This is necessary for accurately computing of widths and heights.

```tsx
<EmojiPicker emojiPadding={5} />
```

## Translating messages

Localization is important, and thus, all messages within the picker can be translated with the
`messages` prop. This prop accepts an object of message keys to translated strings. The list of
[available messages can be found here](https://github.com/milesj/interweave/blob/master/packages/emoji-picker/src/constants.ts#L132).

```tsx
<EmojiPicker
	locale="ja"
	messages={{
		search: 'サーチ',
	}}
/>
```
